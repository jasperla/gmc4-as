{"body":"gmc4-as: Simple and non-optimizing assembler for GMC4.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n------------\r\nThis assembler is for the R-165 instruction set, as used for the GMC4 4-bit\r\nmicrocomputer. This neat little toy was made by Gakken, and can be purchased\r\nvia MakerShed (http://www.makershed.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=MKGK21).\r\n\r\nAfter the initial joy of puzzling a program together I figured I could use this\r\nmicrocomputer to teach myself how to write a basic assembler.\r\n\r\ngmc4-as is a naive (but not stupid) approach. It doesn't use a fully fletched\r\nsyntax tree, or a BNF grammer implemented in Yacc (although I wrote a BNF\r\ngrammer to help me handroll a parser). Essentially there are several passes over\r\nthe source code:\r\n\r\n  - Strip comments, whitespace and remove empty lines\r\n  - Four steps of syntax checking\r\n  - Translating the validated opcodes and operands to instructions\r\n  - Emit the instructions along with their memory addresses\r\n\r\nI haven't done any benchmarking, but since programming the GMC4 easily takes a\r\nfew minutes, I didn't really bother yet optimizing the runtime of the assembler.\r\n\r\nTodo\r\n----\r\nApart from some bugs I'm aware of that need fixing, there are various things\r\nI'd like to implement:\r\n\r\n  - Symbolic label support for JUMP.\r\n  - Better error reporting in case of syntax errors.\r\n  - Better output and more options for formatting.\r\n  - Add a Makefile so this can be installed (for the fool who wants that..)\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nBy default the memory addresses are printed in front of the instructions:\r\n\r\n  gurthang:gmc4-as {2286} cat example/showkey.s\r\n  ; Show the key entered on the display\r\n  KA      ; Read the key\r\n  TIY E\r\n  AM\r\n  TIY F\r\n  TIA 0\r\n  AM\r\n  CAL SUND ; Display the key\r\n  JUMP 00\r\n  gurthang:gmc4-as {2287} perl gmc4-as.pl example/showkey.s\r\n  0x00    0\r\n  0x02    AE\r\n  0x03    4\r\n  0x05    AF\r\n  0x07    80\r\n  0x08    4\r\n  0x09    EB\r\n  0x0b    F0\r\n  0x0c    0\r\n  gurthang:gmc4-as {2288} \r\n\r\nResources\r\n----------\r\n- Great site with the original CPU manual for the Tandy Microcomputer Trainer,\r\n  upon which the GMC4 is based:\r\n  http://www.polylith.com/~brendan/ClassicComputers/Tandy/uCptrTrainManual1.html\r\n- Google Knol about the GMC4:\r\n  http://knol.google.com/k/programming-the-gakken-gmc-4-microcomputer\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright and License\r\n---------------------\r\nWritten by Jasper Lievisse Adriaanse <jasper@humppa.nl>, released under the\r\nterms of the liberal ISC license.
